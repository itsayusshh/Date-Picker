Date Range Picker (React + TypeScript)

This project is a simple and clean date range picker built using React 18 and TypeScript.  
I created it as part of a technical assignment to practice building real-world components without relying on ready-made UI or date picker libraries.

The main goal was to understand how date selection logic works internally, improve my TypeScript skills, and write maintainable, reusable React code.

 Tech Stack
- React 18
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

Features
- Select start and end dates easily
- Works with both keyboard and mouse
- Fully controlled component state
- No external UI or date picker libraries used
